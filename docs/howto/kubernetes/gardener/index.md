# Gardener

Gardener is a Kubernetes-native system that provides automated
management and operation of Kubernetes clusters as a service.  It
allows you to create clusters and automatically handle their lifecycle
operations, including configurable maintenance windows, hibernation
schedules, and automatic updates to Kubernetes control plane and
worker nodes.

You can read more about Gardener and its capabilities on its
[documentation website](https://gardener.cloud/docs/gardener/).
