# Changing your account data

You may at any time change the contact person, address, company name, and purchase order number associated with your {{brand}} account.

To get started, navigate to the [{{gui}}](https://{{gui_domain}}).
Log in and click the _Profile_ button at the top right.

Finalize your changes by clicking the green _Update_ button at the bottom.

## Adding or removing email addresses

In the _Account settings_ pane, click the middle tab, labeled _Contact_.
This will show your currently configured email addresses.
If there is only one email address, it will have all available roles enabled.

The system will then send an automated email containing a verification code.

## Changing an account's organization number

Please note that you cannot readily change your organization number (for business accounts) or your personal number (for individual accounts) in the {{gui}}.

In case you do wish to change any of those, you will have to submit a [{{legal_docs.transfer_form.name}}]({{legal_docs.transfer_form.url}}) via our [{{support}}](https://{{support_domain}}/servicedesk).
