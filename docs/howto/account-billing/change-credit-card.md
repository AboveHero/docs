# Changing your credit card data

You can only change your credit card when you _pay a new invoice_ via
the [{{gui}}](https://{{gui_domain}}).

## Prerequisites

You must be logged in to your [Cleura Cloud](https://{{gui_domain}})
account to switch credit cards.

## Change credit card

Navigate to the Dashboard list in the left-hand menu and click on _Invoices_.

with three dots_ beside the invoice you want to pay.

(Debit/Credit)_.
