## Changing an account's organization number

Please note that you cannot readily change your organization number (for business accounts) or your personal number (for individual accounts) in the {{gui}}.

In case you do wish to change any of those, you will have to submit a [{{legal_docs.transfer_form.name}}]({{legal_docs.transfer_form.url}}) via our [{{support}}](https://{{support_domain}}/servicedesk).
