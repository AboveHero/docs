# Changing your account billing data

Via [{{gui}}](https://{{gui_domain}}) you can change the contact
person, address, company name, and purchase order number associated
with your account.

To get started, navigate to <https://{{gui_domain}}>. Log in and
click on the _Profile_ button at the top right.

Finish your changes by clicking the green _Update_ button at the
bottom.

## Changing an account's organization number

You cannot change your organization number (for business accounts) or
personal number (for individual accounts) in {{gui}}.

This requires that you submit a [legal_docs.transfer_form.name]({{legal_docs.transfer_form.url}}) via our
[{{support}}](https://{{support_domain}}/servicedesk).
